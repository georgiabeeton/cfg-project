## Project's aim
These webpages have been made by Georgia and Malva as part of an introduction to web development course with Code First Girls.
We designed a recipe website, with various different recipes as well as embedded videos on each recipe page.

## Technologies
For this project, we used HTML and CSS.

## Project status 
We have 6 recipe pages coded up, to improve we could have added a few more recipes, and also tried to incorporate JavaScript!
