        <h2> Method </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a large bowl, add the flour, yeast, baking soda, salt and sugar. Make sure to add the yeast and salt on separate sides of the bowl as salt directly on yeast can kill it </li>
            <li> In a separate jug, combine the warmed milk and water </li>
            <li> Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the liquids. </li>
            <li> Whisk from the centre outwards until the consistency of a thin batter and there are no lumps </li>
            <li> Cover with cling film and a tea towel and set aside for 1 hour </li>
            <li> Grease 4 10cm metal rings with vegetable oil</li>
            <li> Wipe a little oil around a frying pan and place over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li> Place the rings in the frying pan </li>
            <li> Once hot, spoon the batter into each ring until 1/2 way full </li>
            <li> Cook until little bubbles appear on the surface (around 7 mins)</li>
            <li> Once the bubbles have burst and the crumpets are dry on top, lift off the rings using tongs and flip over the crumpets. Cook for a further 2 mins</li>
            <li> Re-grease and reheat the rings and pan before cooking the next batch </li>
            <li> Serve the crumpets warm with butter</li>
        </ol>
